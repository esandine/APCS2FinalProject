-<Name>
-New Features:
-Bugs Added:
-Bugs Fixed:
-Goals

05/27/2016:
-Ely Sandine
-New Features:
-Trim function fixes the problem of Rotate making the images too big
-Bugs Added:
-loss of pixels when rotating
-Bugs Fixed:
-Rotate is fixed
-Goals
-Make Rotate better

05/26/2016:
-Ely Sandine
-New Features:
-Rotation works by enlarging the image and spinning it
-Bugs Added:
-Need to full test rotating,
-Some pixels disapper
-Bugs Fixed:
-Fixed the trig problems
-Goals
-Test rotating more,
-make a program that cuts down the white space
05/25/2016:
-Ely Sandine
-New Features:
-added rotating by converting to polar coordinates then back into normal array
-Bugs Added:
-Rotating does not work and throws exception
-Bugs Fixed:
-none
-Goals
-Fix rotations

05/24/2016:
-Ely Sandine
-New Features:
-booleanArrays are now scalable
-no more rescaling of image files, only boolean arrays
-Bugs Added:
-Potentially less accurate with a very simple scaling method
-Bugs Fixed:
-faster
-Goals
-rotating

05/22/2016:
-Ely Sandine
-New Features:
-Used booleanCharacter class to make loadDirectory which converts all files in a directory to a hashtable with the booleanArray of the picture and a string with the name
-added closestMatch() which compares the booleanArray to all the other characters to find which character it is
-rescale class rescales images
-Bugs Added:
-closestMatch is not very accurate (when comparing a B from the internet it said W"
-Bugs Fixed:
-Made percentError more efficient
-Made booleanCharacters automatically rescale images
-Determined the problem is scaling
-Made the program run much faster
-Goals:
-improve speed
-improve accuracy
-be able to identify letters

05/18/2016:
-Ely Sandine
-New Features:
-percentError method takes two images and retuns the percent error between them
-Bugs Added:
-It prints alot of numbers while it is running, I am not sure why
-Bugs Fixed:
-none
-Goals
-Made a bunch of booleanArrays to check if a letter is the same as another

05/17/2016:
-Ely Sandine
-New Features:
-Created class booleanArray
-Created class Read with static methods
-Read.loadBoolean(String): creates a booleanArray given the name of an image file
-Read.compare(String,String,double): compares the two images and calculates a percent error when both are converted to black and white
-Bugs Added:
-Messy
-Bugs Fixed:
-none
-Goals
-Clean up code
-calculate a percent error given two images

05/16/2016:
-Ely Sandine
-New Features:
-added toBoolean() that converts the array of pixels into booleans with true marking the pixel is part of the character
-Bugs Added:
-Merging with git is not fully understood so it is possible something my have been messed up
-Have not tested the new function yet
-Bugs Fixed:
-none
-Goals
-Work on comparison between image and characters

05/13/2016:
-Ely Sandine
-New Features:
-Pixel class keeps track of each pixel
-setRGBValues() converts the pixels back to the image
-outPut takes a file, proccesses it and writes it in a new file
-setBlackAndWhite() converts the pixels to black and white
-Bugs Added:
-none
-Bugs Fixed:
-none
-Goals:
-Comparing with images to get letters

Project Plan:
0) Learn to read image files and convert to pixels
1) Read image files with single characters
2) Read image files with lines of characters
3) Differentiate between spaces
4) Blocks of text
5) Utilize different fonts
6) Find the characters in a image
7) More fonts
8) Put it into calculator or something
